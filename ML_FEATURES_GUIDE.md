## üöÄ Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms
- `textblob`: Basic sentiment analysis
- `transformers`: Advanced NLP models
- `torch`: Deep learning framework
- `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation

### Step 2: Using ML Features

#### Basic Usage:
```python
from src.ml_models.ml_integration import MLAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
ml_analyzer = MLAnalyzer()

# Run comprehensive analysis
results = ml_analyzer.analyze_reviews(review_dataframe)

# Access specific results
sentiment_analysis = results['sentiment_analysis']
quality_analysis = results['quality_analysis']
recommendations = results['recommendations']
```

#### Advanced Usage:
```python
# Individual model usage
from src.ml_models.sentiment_analysis import SentimentAnalyzer
from src.ml_models.review_quality import ReviewQualityAnalyzer

# Sentiment analysis only
sentiment_analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer(model_type="transformer")
sentiment_result = sentiment_analyzer.analyze_sentiment_textblob("Great product!")

# Quality analysis only
quality_analyzer = ReviewQualityAnalyzer()
quality_features = quality_analyzer.extract_quality_features("review text", 4.5)
```

### Step 3: Streamlit Integration
